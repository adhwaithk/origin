"""
This code defines a unit test suite for a Flask application.
 It uses the unittest library to create test cases for various routes and endpoints of the Flask app.
 The test suite also includes a custom test client that extends Client from the werkzeug.test module.
 
 The code begins by importing necessary modules and classes.
  unittest is used for defining test cases,
   Flask is imported to create a test client,
    Response is used for representing HTTP responses, and Client from werkzeug.test is the
  base class for the custom test client. Finally, app is imported from the Flask application to be tested.
  
  This section defines a custom test client by subclassing Client
  
  This section defines a test class TestApp that inherits from unittest.TestCase.
   The setUp method is used to set up the test environment before each test case is executed.
    It creates a test client for the Flask app, sets the testing mode to True,
   and assigns the custom test client class (CustomTestClient) to the test client instance.
   
   This section defines individual test methods for different routes and endpoints of the Flask app.
    Each test method sends a request to a specific endpoint using the test client (self.app)
    and checks whether the response status code is equal to 200, indicating a successful response.
    
    Test methods in the unittest framework must start with the word "test."
    
    This line uses the test client self.app to send an HTTP GET request to the '/auth/google'
     endpoint of the Flask application. It captures the HTTP response in the response variable.
     
     This line uses the assertEqual method provided by unittest.TestCase to
      check whether the HTTP response status code (response.status_code)
      is equal to 200. If the status code is not 200, the test will fail.
      
      similiarly others also
    
    These test methods are part of a unit test suite, and they are used to verify that the
     various routes and endpoints of the Flask application are functioning as expected. 
    If any of these assertions fail during testing, it indicates a potential issue with the
     application's behavior.
